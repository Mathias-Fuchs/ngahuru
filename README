Ngahuru - GTK+ based simple text editor


Description
===========

Ngahuru is a simple GTK+ text editor written with the intention to be another interpretation of a distraction-free text editor.
Most parts of its code are based on leafpad source code, version 0.8.17.
Ngahuru is Maori for "autumn" - which is reminiscent of the "leaf" in "leafpad".
It differs from leafpad in syntax highlighting and the invitation to quickly hide the menu bar with Ctrl-m.
When it's hidden, you can't do anything in Ngahuru EXCEPT type, which is exactly what you might want to do.


Features
========

  * Absence of features
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Codeset option (Some OpenI18N registered)
  * Auto codeset detection (UTF-8 and some codesets)
  * Unlimitted Undo/Redo
  * Auto/Multi-line Indent
  * Display line numbers
  * Drag and Drop
  * Printing


Installation
============

Ngahuru requires:
  * GTK+-2.x.x libraries.
  * GTKSOURCEVIEW2.0 libraries.
Printing (optional) requires libgnomeprintui-2.2.

Simple install procedure:

  $ tar xzvf ngahuru-x.x.tar.gz       # unpack the sources
  $ cd ngahuru-x.x                   # change to the toplevel directory
  $ ./configure                         # run the `configure' script
  $ make                                # build Ngahuru
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  # make install-strip                  # install Ngahuru
